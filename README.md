## Whiskers and Wags Pet Adoption Agency
Welcome to Whiskers and Wags Pet Adoption Agency! We are dedicated to finding loving homes for animals in need. This README.md file provides an overview of our agency and guidelines for using our services.

## About Whiskers and Wags
-At Whiskers and Wags, our mission is to facilitate the adoption of companion animals and promote responsible pet ownership. We believe that every animal deserves a safe and caring home, and we strive to match each pet with a loving family that suits their unique needs.

We take pride in ensuring the welfare and well-being of the animals in our care, and we prioritize the happiness and satisfaction of both pets and adopters.

## Services Offered
# Pet Adoption
Whiskers and Wags offers a comprehensive pet adoption service. We provide a user-friendly website and a physical adoption center where potential adopters can browse through profiles of available animals. Our adoption process includes:

-Browse and Select: Prospective adopters can explore the profiles of animals available for adoption. Each profile includes information about the pet's breed, age, personality traits, and any specific requirements.

-Meet and Greet: Once a potential match is identified, we encourage adopters to schedule a meet and greet session with the pet. This allows both the adopter and the pet to interact and determine if they are a good fit for each other.
Application and Screening: If the meet and greet is successful, adopters can complete an adoption application. Our team carefully reviews each application to ensure a suitable match, which may involve reference checks and a home visit.

-Adoption Fee and Paperwork: Once approved, adopters are required to pay an adoption fee, which helps cover the costs of caring for the animals. We also provide the necessary paperwork and guidance to complete the adoption process.

-Pet Surrender
We understand that circumstances may change, and sometimes pet owners are unable to continue caring for their animals. Whiskers and Wags accepts pet surrenders under certain circumstances. If you need to surrender a pet, please reach out to our agency to discuss the process and requirements.

-Volunteer and Donation Opportunities
Whiskers and Wags relies on the support of volunteers and donations to continue our work. We welcome individuals who are passionate about animal welfare to join our team as volunteers. Additionally, we greatly appreciate any monetary contributions or donations of pet supplies that can help us provide the best care for the animals in our program.
